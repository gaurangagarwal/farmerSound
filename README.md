# farmerSound
This APP focuses on the local FM channels run by the Government.
We have lots of online /offline apps which utilize various API's use a lot of research and analysis to provide information to the farmers.
But what these dont recognize is the Authenticated information provided daily by the Indiian Government.
It  has a lot of resourceful data available which this app utilizes successfully.
We maintain a Server to store recorded Fm channels broadcasts and also a tutorial in local dialect which can be the responsibility of the local agricultural officer/employee.

These files can be successfully downloaded by the users and also they can use an offline feature where we use EXotel API to ask the user to give a call select proper information.
What Exotel does is give our server a call and we provide the necesssary information via an SMS.
